## Parsimonious graphs on triads for Douthett's and Steinbach's P<sub>m,n</sub> relations

Access to the interactive page is [available here](https://alexpof.github.io/interactive_mathmusic/Pmn_graphs/pmn_graphs.html)

This interactive visualization presents Douthett's and Steinbach's P<sub>m,n</sub> relations on various triads.
Two triads are said to be P<sub>m,n</sub>-related if *m* pitch classes move by a semitone,
while *n* pitch classes move by a whole tone, the rest of the pitch classes being identical.
The set of triads and the set of P<sub>m,n</sub> relations can be selected from the page. The nodes are clickable and will let you play the
corresponding chord.
Shift-clicking on a node saves the chord in a progression which can then be replayed.
